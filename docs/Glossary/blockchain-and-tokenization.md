# Blockchain & Tokenization
- ERC-20:
    - A technical standard for tokens issued on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring compatibility with the broader Ethereum ecosystem.
- ERC-721:
    - A standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing for unique, indivisible tokens representing digital or physical assets.
- ERC-3643:
    - A token standard on the Ethereum blockchain for compliant security tokens, facilitating regulated asset transactions.
- Security Token:
    - A digital token that represents ownership in a regulated financial asset, such as shares in a company, and complies with securities laws.
- Asset-Referenced Token:
    - A type of cryptocurrency that is backed by real-world assets, such as commodities or real estate, providing stability and intrinsic value.
- Smart Contract:
    - A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, running on a blockchain.
- Tokenization:
    - The process of converting ownership rights to an asset into digital tokens that can be traded on a blockchain.
- Wallet:
- A digital tool that allows users to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies or tokens.
- Yield Farming:
    - The practice of staking or lending cryptocurrency assets to generate high returns or rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency.
- Liquidity Pool:
    - A collection of funds locked in a smart contract, used to facilitate trading by providing liquidity.
- Proof of Stake (PoS):
    - A consensus mechanism where validators are chosen to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral.
- Proof of Work (PoW):
    - A consensus mechanism used by some blockchains where miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks.
- Layer 1 Blockchain:
    - The base layer of a blockchain network that handles all transaction data and consensus. Examples include Bitcoin and Ethereum.
- Layer 2 Blockchain:
    - An overlaying network built on top of a Layer 1 blockchain to improve scalability and efficiency, such as the Lightning Network on Bitcoin or Optimism on Ethereum.
- Permissioned Blockchain:
    - A blockchain where access to the network is restricted to specific participants, providing controlled and secure environments for business applications.
- Permissionless Blockchain:
    - A blockchain where anyone can join and participate without needing approval, ensuring openness and decentralization.
