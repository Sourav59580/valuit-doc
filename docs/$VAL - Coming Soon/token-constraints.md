# Token Constraints

### Endogenous:

- Deflationary token
    - Include buyback and burning of tokens ****
- Token should have a clear and specific value in the ecosystem
    - The utilities of the token are described above.
- The total number of tokens should be limited to ensure scarcity and encourage value accumulation
    - When modeling, we include a cap on the maximum token supply.
- The token design should correspond to the goals and objectives of Valuit and its business model
    - The token utilities are developed taking into account all the current platform features.
- The token design should take into account the needs and preferences of the target audience and users
    - The utilities are developed taking into account user segmentation into three types: Platform users, token holders, market makers, companies (described below in the table).
- The token design should be flexible enough to not hinder future growth and development of Valuit ecosystem.
    - When modeling, it is assumed that additional utilities may be added to the token as the project develops and new products are developed.
- **$VAL** tokens should be compatible with the technical infrastructure of the Valuit
- The token design should prioritize security and minimize the risk of hacking or attacks on the platform and its users
- The token design should take into account regulatory issues and comply with relevant laws and regulations
    - This is not a security token.
- The token design should be transparent and easily understandable to users, investors, and other stakeholders
    - For existing platform products, the token has transparent utilities that are described and explained in a text document
- The token design should stimulate long-term participation in Valuit ecosystem and reward loyal users
    - The token utilities paragraph in the tokenomics is designed to use tokens to encourage long-term token holding and reward loyal users.
- The token design should avoid creating conflicts of interest between different stakeholders in the Valuit ecosystem
    - Tokenomics articles take into account the interests of the majority of stakeholders, so that everyone has the opportunity to benefit from participation in the ecosystem.

### Exogenous:

- Volatility of financial and crypto markets, cyclicality of the global economy
    - Modeling calculates the amount of liquidity needed to maintain a stable price level, avoiding significant drops due to speculation.
- Crises and shocks in the economy
    - Affects the entire crypto market, leads to reduced activity in projects, and investors exiting them.
- Technological innovations in the crypto space
    - Competition from other ecosystem projects which may lead to decreasing active users at Valuit platform
- Availability and accessibility of liquidity pools and decentralized exchanges
    - The blockchain chosen for the token must be supported by a multitude of DeFi protocols with which the token can interact.
- Changes in user behavior and preferences, such as changes in demand for certain products or services
    - A change in trend in the crypto space may lead to the project shifting focus to DeFi and developing the wallet or other directions as a products.
- Changes in global rules and legal frameworks for cryptocurrencies and protocols
    - Legal aspects need to be taken into account when choosing the target audience and regions of its presence.
- Social factors, such as public perception and attitudes towards cryptocurrencies
